        Hi, thank you for visiting my website. I am an engineer with 3+ years of
        experience working in product development and product quality within the
        outdoor industry. My passions are cooking, cycling, running, spending
        time outdoors, music, and programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born in Charlotte, NC, and lived there until attending Appalachian
        State University in Boone, NC. In school I excelled at math but
        struggled to find an application of that skill that excited me. At
        Appalachian State, I took my first physics course and realized that this
        was exactly what I was looking for. I changed my major to applied
        physics shortly after that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my under graduate degree I became interested in working with
        electronics and gravitated towards the courses that got me experience
        designing, building, and testing circuits. This lead to me applying for
        the graduate engineering physics degree offered at Appalachian State,
        which I was accepted into.
      </p>
      <p>
        The engineering physics program was where I was first introduced to
        programming. Oddly enough the first programming 'language' that I ever
        learned was LabVIEW. I'm sure there are some pros and countless cons to
        starting with a graphical programming language such as LabVIEW, but I
        quickly moved on to other languages including assembly, C, C#, MATLAB,
        VHDL, and ladder logic for PLCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        While finishing my under graduate and degree and then also while working
        on my graduate degree at Appalachian State I was involved with the
        university's solar vehicle team, Team Sunergy. Team Sunergy was formed a
        few years before I joined, and had had success in previous years
        competing at the annual Formula Sun Grand Prix, a multi-day track race
        event, and the biennial American Solar Challenge, a multi-day point to
        point race on real roads with real cars. The team was split into
        subteams, business/operations, electrical, and mechanical. Naturally I
        joined the electrical team and began to learn about the system that
        powered the car.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first year with the team, we travelled to Austin, TX to compete in
        the Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) at the Circuit of the Americas Formula
        1 track. That year we raced Apperion, our single-occupant solar vehicle
        whose body and solar cells had been donated to Appalachian State from
        Iowa State but whose electronics and suspension had been built and
        maintained by our team. After multiple long days on the track filled
        with ups and downs, we placed 2nd as we had completed the 2nd most
        amount of laps throughout the time on the track. There was no American
        Solar Challenge (ASC) this year, so our team returned to NC after a
        successful FSGP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following year I was nominated as the head of the electrical team on
        Team Sunergy, which was a large task as we had decided to ditch Apperion
        and to build a new solar vehicle from the ground up.
