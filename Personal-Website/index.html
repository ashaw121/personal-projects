        Hi, thank you for visiting my website. I am an engineer with 3+ years of
        experience working in product development and product quality within the
        outdoor industry. My passions are cooking, cycling, running, spending
        time outdoors, music, and programming.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              I was born in Charlotte, NC, and lived there until attending
              Appalachian State University in Boone, NC. In school I excelled at
              math but struggled to find an application of that skill that
              excited me. At Appalachian State, I took my first physics course
              and realized that this was exactly what I was looking for. I
              changed my major to applied physics shortly after that.
            </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
              Throughout my undergraduate degree I became interested in working
              with electronics and gravitated towards the courses that got me
              experience designing, building, and testing circuits. This lead to
              me applying for the graduate engineering physics degree offered at
              Appalachian State, which I was accepted into.
            </p>
            <p>
              The engineering physics program was where I was first introduced
              to programming. Oddly enough the first programming 'language' that
              I ever learned was LabVIEW. I'm sure there are some pros and
              countless cons to starting with a graphical programming language
              such as LabVIEW, but I quickly moved on to other languages
              including assembly, C, C#, MATLAB, VHDL, and ladder logic for
              PLCs.

            <h2>Team Sunergy</h2>
            <p>
              While finishing my undergraduate and degree and then also while
              working on my graduate degree at Appalachian State I was involved
              with the university's solar vehicle team, Team Sunergy. Team
              Sunergy was formed a few years before I joined, and had had
              success in previous years competing at the annual Formula Sun
              Grand Prix, a multi-day track race event, and the biennial
              American Solar Challenge, a multi-day point to point race on real
              roads with real cars. The team was split into subteams,
              business/operations, electrical, and mechanical. Naturally I
              joined the electrical team and began to learn about the system
              that powered the car.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first year with the team, we travelled to Austin, TX to compete
              in the Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) at the Circuit of the
              Americas Formula 1 track. That year we raced Apperion, our
              single-occupant solar vehicle whose body and solar cells had been
              donated to Appalachian State from Iowa State but whose electronics
              and suspension had been built and maintained by our team. After
              multiple long days on the track filled with ups and downs, we
              placed 2nd as we had completed the 2nd most amount of laps
              throughout the time on the track. There was no American Solar
              Challenge (ASC) this year, so our team returned to NC after a
              successful FSGP.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following year I was nominated as the head of the electrical
              team on Team Sunergy, which was a large task as we had decided to
              ditch Apperion and to build a new solar vehicle from the ground
              up. The competitions were introducing a new category, for
              multi-occupant vehicles, and we wanted to be one of the first
              teams to enter this category, so in less than a year we built a
              two-person solar vehicle from nothing. I lead a team of students
              in the design and build of the electrical system, and personally
              designed and built the battery pack and battery management system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following Summer we brought our new car, ROSE, to the FSGP and
              ASC and placed 2nd and 1st respectively for the multi-occupant
              class.

            <h2>Internship Experience</h2>
            <p>
              The Summer after finishing graduate school I accepted an
              internship offer with Borg Warner in Asheville, NC. This was a
              short, 6 week internship as this was the same Summer that I was
              racing ROSE. This was also the first internship I had accepted
              because I had sacrificed my previous Summers on working with Team
              Sunergy on the solar car.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this internship it was my responsibility to automate a time
              consuming process of calibrating k-type thermocouples that were
              used to measure super high temperatures while testing
              turbochargers. This was to be achieved using LabVIEW using a
              queued message handler. The computer was to set the temperature of
              a calibration bath device using RS-232 and read the thermocouples'
              temperatures from a Fluke Black Stack using RS-422.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my 6 weeks I tested, documented, and began implementing the
              commands to the calibration bath and the Fluke, and laid out the
              structure of queued message handler. I handed my work over to
              another intern as it was never planned for the project to be
              finished in 6 weeks.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
              After finishing the American Solar Challenge I moved to Brooklyn,
              NY to search for a job. After a few months I found a paid
              internship at BioLite and was offered a position after
              interviewing. I was not thrilled about the title 'Intern' but I
              was excited to get my foot in the door working in consumer
              electronics, especially in the outdoor industry. I was also
              determined that I could turn my internship into a full-time
              position once I started.
